        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          Wynnum Redlands Upholsterers has been operating in the Wynnum Manly area since 1982. For over 40 years, we've built a reputation for quality workmanship and attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-6">
          We specialise in recovering and refurbishing furniture, boat interiors and caravans, while we can also custom make furniture to suit your needs. Our focus has always been on quality, specialist work - never mass production.
